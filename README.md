# Diverse associations and proximate effects of weather on southeastern Madagascar flowering phenology

Investigate the associations between monthly weather (i.e., rainfall, temperature and insolation) and species-level flowering and fruiting phenology of tropical plants. Developed Bayesian process-based models to identify the potential weather cues that tropical species use to regulate their flowering time.
